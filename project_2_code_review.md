[X] README.md included
[X] Slides included
[X] Code included

## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Good job using inline coding
- For future projects think about how you can move work from jupyter notebooks to functins and py files. 
  So you will py files for your functions to scrape, clean, and model. 

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md, include your summary/findings and a quick overview of your process/methodology.
- Markdown cells at the beginning of each section can helped layout the foundation for upcoming cells. 
  Here you can explain what the model produced and/or discuss why you are taking the next steps. 
- Layout of github was clear and concise. 


## Proper Data Science:


- Good job working through 

- Great use of the RFECV and Variance Inflation Factor, narrowing features for sport data sets is a difficult task. 
- Good workflow of going through Lasso,Ridge, LR. 
- Good thought to transform the target.
- Reminder you can create py files for your modeling process.

## Comments:

- Good job on project 2! :)
- Would love to hear why your model undershot the salary? Do you think you need to build different models for the different tiers of salaries?
